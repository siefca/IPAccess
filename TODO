Specification:

- add missing rspec examples

Ruby 1.9 sockets:

- overload Ruby 1.9 socket methods

Documentation:

- add more documentation describing access checking workflow

- move docs to docs subdirectory

Errors:

- add some class with method_missing that raises an ArgumentError
  and then assign its instance to @acl instead of nil when setting
  list to global

Other:

- re-check where we can use *args

- maybe some day: test input lists even if socket is a client socket - local socket address permit/deny
