# Classes contained in this library allow you to create
# and manage IP access lists in an easy way. You may use
# IPAccess class to maintain black list and white list
# and validate connections against it. You also may use
# IPAccessList class directly to build your own lists.
#
# The classes use IPAddr objects to store data and IPAddrList
# to create lists with binary search capabilities.

# This version of IPSocket class uses IPAccess to control
# incomming and outgoing connections.

class IPSocket
