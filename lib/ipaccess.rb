# Classes contained in this library allow you to create
# and manage IP access lists in an easy way. You may use
# IPAccess class to maintain black list and white list
# and validate connections against it. You also may use
# IPAccessList class directly to build your own lists.
#
# The classes use NetAddr::CIDR objects to store IP
# addresses/masks and NetAddr::Tree to maintain
# access lists.
