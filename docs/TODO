== IPAccess

=== Blocks

- possibility to add block to access lists, the block will be evaluated when match
- possibility to add block to sockets and familiar, the block will be evaluated when access is denied but before connection is dropped (if it is)
- pass sockets, etc. when block called

=== Specification

- add missing rspec examples

== Documentation

- sockets: document initialize
- mention about on-demand loading of patching engine

== Other

- inspect methods?

== Future

- overload Ruby 1.9 socket methods
- utilize @debug_mode in certain network objects to pring access denied message
- maybe some day: test input lists even if socket is a client socket - local socket address permit/deny
- to speed up ACL seeks maybe a small, fast buffer for up to 128 IP matches cleaned when something will change?
