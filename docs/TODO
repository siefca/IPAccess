== IPAccess

- create a bus that will trigger rechecks for all objects that are using given access set.

- add examples with blocks
- check all overloaded class methods that take blocks for bugs

=== Specification

- add missing rspec examples

== Documentation

- rewrite docs for patches to use proxy methods!!!
- insert hints in documentation: acl.output.blacklist before object is created and obj.blacklist when it exists as a good example!
- add IPAccess::Net ghost-doc
- sockets: document initializers and other stuff that takes :opened_on_deny

== Other

- inspect methods?

== Ruby 1.8

- ok

== Future

- ability to react on greylisted entries? :)
- some Ruby 1.9-specific socket methods
- utilize @debug_mode in certain network objects to pring access denied message
- maybe some day: test input lists even if socket is a client socket - local socket address permit/deny
- to speed up ACL seeks maybe a small, fast buffer for up to 128 IP matches cleaned when something will change?
