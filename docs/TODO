=== Blocks

- possibility to add block to access lists, the block will be evaluated when match
- possibility to add block to sockets and familiar, the block will be evaluated when access is denied but before connection is dropped (if it is)
- pass sockets, etc. when block called

=== Specification

- add missing rspec examples

=== Sockets

- overload Ruby 1.9 socket methods
- patch OpenSSL::Socket
- patch Net::HTTP and familiar
- arm socket objects real-time when used by Net::HTTP and familiar (shared ACLs)
- allow arming of objects' singletons [todo: how to distinguish between singleton class and regular class]
- utilize @debug_mode in certain networking objects to pring access denied message

=== Documentation

- add more documentation describing access checking workflow
- precise that return value from check is a pair (in many places)

=== Other

- create server sockets with list given in initializer
- maybe some day: test input lists even if socket is a client socket - local socket address permit/deny
- inspect methods?
