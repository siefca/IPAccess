== IPAccess

- add support for reason when adding to list. Use NetAddr::CIDR fields.

- scream! method should not pass anything to obj if the obj is nil - don't mess with zohan

- TEST getaddress agains known error with getaddresses (that has workaround)

=== Specification

- add missing rspec examples

== Documentation

- sockets: document initializers
- blocks for check_ methods
- describe access checking workflow using diagram

== Other

- inspect methods?

== Future

- overload Ruby 1.9 socket methods
- utilize @debug_mode in certain network objects to pring access denied message
- maybe some day: test input lists even if socket is a client socket - local socket address permit/deny
- to speed up ACL seeks maybe a small, fast buffer for up to 128 IP matches cleaned when something will change?
