- add missing rspec examples

- add more documentation describing access checking workflow

- patch more sockets
- possibility to choose whether to patch main socket class or just singletons of the given objects (but what about sockets that are created by listen? - check it)

- maybe some day: test input lists even if socket is a client socket (read local socket address)


- add IPAccess methods for adding and deleting from both input and output rulesets
  OR bidirectional mode with just one list (input) and other list pointing to first
  problem: global list

- overload Ruby 1.9 socket methods
