- add missing rspec examples

- add more documentation describing access checking workflow

- patch more sockets
- possibility to choose whether to patch main socket class or just singletons of the given objects (but what about sockets that are created by listen? - check it)

- maybe some day: test input lists even if socket is a client socket (read local socket address)
